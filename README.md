# Suraj's Travel App Project

## Overview

This project is an asynchronous web app that uses OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, and Pixabay to dynamically update the UI according to user input.

## Instructions

Run `npm install` to install dependencies (cors, body-parser and express). Then run the command `npm run start` in the terminal to instantiate the server. The command line should output "App listening on localhost:8081".

You can then open the dev build by running `npm run dev` (this command will automatically open the browser to localhost:8080 but communicate with the server on port 8081), or the prod build by running `npm run build`, then manually navigating to localhost:8081 in the browser.
