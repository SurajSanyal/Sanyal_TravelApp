# Suraj's Travel App Project

## Overview

This project is an asynchronous web app that uses OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, and Pixabay to dynamically update the UI according to user input.

## Instructions

Run `npm install` to install dependencies (cors, body-parser and express). Then run the command `node server.js` in the terminal to instantiate the server. The command line should output "App listening on localhost:8081". Navigate to "localhost:8081" in your browser while the server is running to see the web app.
